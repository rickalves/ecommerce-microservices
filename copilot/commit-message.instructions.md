# Commit message rules (Conventional Commits)

Use Conventional Commits:
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

Types: feat, fix, refactor, perf, docs, test, chore, build, ci, style, revert

Rules:

- Write in Portuguese (pt-BR).
- subject: imperative, concise, max 72 chars, no trailing dot.
- scope: infer from changed area (api, auth, db, ui, messaging, docs, config, tests, ci, etc.). If unsure, omit scope.
- If there are multiple relevant changes, prefer one main subject + body with bullets.
- Generate the message in markdown format ready to copy.
- Don't include backtick marks.

Body (optional):

- Add a blank line after subject.
- Use bullets with what changed and why (when helpful).
- If breaking change, add:
  BREAKING CHANGE: <describe impact + migration>

Do NOT:

- Mention “generated by Copilot”.
- Add emojis.
- Add generic messages like “update files”.
